        <p>The nature park is named after the river Ala-Archa which flows through it. In Kyrgyz, the archa, which
            gives the river and the park its name, is a bright or many-colored juniper which the Kyrgyz people have
            traditionally held in special esteem, using smoke from its burning wood to chase away evil spirits.
            However, the archa is not supposed to be planted near the home, because it is believed gradually to sap
            the energy from human beings living close-by.</p>
